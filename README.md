# Link's True Journey Part 2

## Overview

Link's True Journey Part 2 is a 3D first-person horror game created using Java and the libDGX library 

The objective of the game is to collect the keys scattered accross the map and place them in a generator. Beware however, as there will be a monstrous spider hunting you throughout the game, and getting caught means game over! You can defend yourself by placing stun grenades on the floor that will temporarely stun the spider so you can escape. The location of the keys and the generator are random so you will have to search for them!
